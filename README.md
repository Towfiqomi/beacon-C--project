I have chosen following data structure, because


# Struct

- Used struct so that I can handle a group of data easily.
- Getting info from struct is easy and fun.


# Map

- stores data with unique key and value.
- the insertion and serching time complexity is O(logN) which was my estimation.

# vector

- sorting is easy with vector.
- its fun and easy to access and traverse vector with iterators. 
- 


I have choosen following data structure for the programming task 2:

# Unordered map

- Gives functionality to store key and value.
- all keys are unique
- searching time complexity is O(n)
- The hash function givs O(1) time complexity.

# Vector

- sorting is easy with vector.
- its fun and easy to access and traverse vector with iterators.
